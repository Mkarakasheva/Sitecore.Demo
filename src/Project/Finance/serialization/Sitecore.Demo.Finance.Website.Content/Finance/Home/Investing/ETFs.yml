        <h3>What are ETFs?</h3>
        <p>An ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is a collection of securities such as equities, bonds, and options that is bought and sold like a stock in on a stock exchange. Most ETFs are designed to track an index. Because it trades like a stock, an ETF does not have its net asset value calculated every day like a mutual fund does. The upside is that ETFs can offer potential growth from market price appreciation and provide a sound way to diversify your general investment portfolio. The downside, is that they are subject to market volatility and therefore open to market price risk.</p>
