        <p>The global EMV migration is well underway. But what exactly is EMV? If you've gotten a new credit card from your bank recently, it probably looks a little different. New cards now come with something called EMV, which stands for &ldquo;Europay, MasterCard, and Visa.&rdquo; In short, they contain a super-small computer chip that&rsquo;s extremely hard to counterfeit.</p>
        <p>Why the big switch? Almost half of the world&rsquo;s credit card fraud happens in the United States&mdash;even though only a quarter of all credit card transactions happen here. The banks want to fight this fraud by moving away from magnetic-stripe cards, which are much easier to fake. </p>
