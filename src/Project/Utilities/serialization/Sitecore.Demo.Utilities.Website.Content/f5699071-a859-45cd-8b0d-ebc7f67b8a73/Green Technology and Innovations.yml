      Value: "Habitat advances renewable energy technologies through research and development projects. We want to help find cutting-edge solutions to green energy efficiency. That's why we developed our GTI (Green Technology Innovations) program. It's a research and development program designed to help you use and evaluate new or underutilized technologies. Unlike many green tech programs, we're focused on real-word projects that can be integrated within 10 years or less. We've completed demonstration projects with solr power, lighting technologies, building envelopes, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and a wide variety of other technologies."
