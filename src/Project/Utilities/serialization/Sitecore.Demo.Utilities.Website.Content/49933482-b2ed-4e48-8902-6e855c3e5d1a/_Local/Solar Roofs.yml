      Hint: TeaserSummary
      Value: "Invisibly powerful, it’s more than just a roof over your head. It's special roof tiles that have solar cells invisible to the naked eye from the street. What looks like a beautiful roof tile is actually an energy-producing innovation. Made of extremely strong tempered glass, these roof tiles can withstand the impact of hail up to 220 mph. That's not surprising since they can take on nearly three times the force of standard roofing tiles. We have a variety of styles to suit almost any home and the roofs cost less than an equivalent roof when you include the projected savings from your utility bill, all of which come with a wide range of financing options."
